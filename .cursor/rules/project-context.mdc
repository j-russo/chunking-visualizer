# Chunking Visualizer — Project Context

**Purpose:** Interactive demo app showing text chunking strategies for RAG systems. Built to demonstrate Svelte competency for a Structured AI interview with CTO Brandon Smith, whose ChromaDB chunking research (https://research.trychroma.com/evaluating-chunking) inspired this project.

**Stack:** SvelteKit (no TypeScript) + Tailwind CSS, deployed to Vercel.

**Target audience:** Technical CTO who authored the referenced chunking paper — keep the implementation credible and the language precise.

## Key Constraints

- No TypeScript — plain JavaScript only (`.js`, `.svelte`)
- Keep it shippable in 4–5 hours; avoid over-engineering
- Semantic chunking is intentionally a mock (paragraph-based proxy); acknowledge this explicitly in UI and README
- Sample texts are construction domain (specs, drawing notes) — this is deliberate context for Structured AI's use case

## File Layout

```
src/
  routes/+page.svelte   # single-page app
  lib/chunkers.js       # 4 chunking algorithms
  lib/metrics.js        # calculateMetrics + calculateIoU
  lib/sampleText.js     # constructionSpec + drawingNote exports
```
